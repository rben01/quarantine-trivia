A collection of trivia games I put together to give friends something to play while hanging out virtually during the coronavirus pandemic.

Except for the music trivia game, the games are all distributed as PDFs and should work fine in any web browser or PDF viewer.
However, it's recommended that you use a viewer that can flip through the pages by pressing the arrow keys in order to avoid scrolling.
You can use the sidebars of the PDFs to navigate between rounds and questions; everything in them is a link. +
Each PDF was built by parsing a Q-and-A list and generating {resource-link-latex}/{resource-link-beamer} source. +
__Trivia 1 was done in an ad-hoc manner and is not available online.__


{github-pages-root}/{name-quarantine-music-trivia}/[__Name That Tune__ Trivia]:::
{repo-quarantine-music-trivia}[{github-icon-in-link}]{repo-quarantine-music-trivia}[{name-quarantine-music-trivia}] +
The questions are all audio clips from well-known songs with prompts such as "`Name the song`", "`Name the album`", and "`What movie had this song as the theme?`". +
The site was built by parsing a list of questions and generating {resource-link-asciidoctor} source. Music clips created with {resource-link-ffmpeg}.
+
[WARNING]
--
The site does not discard media that has been scrolled out of view, so it _will_ use a lot of memory.
Refreshing should purge memory, but I recommend only playing on desktop for the time being.
Hopefully I'll get around to fixing this at some point.
